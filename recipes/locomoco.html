    <h2>
        A Classic Hawaii Comfort Food
    </h2>
        <p>Made by topping rice with a fried burger, which is then smothered with a rich, brown gravy and finished with a fried egg.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, we all get hangry, so this cheap, filling bowl of goodness is the perfect solution, whether you're a broke student or an older professional who wishes you were. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 patties ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <1i>1 pinch cayenne pepper</1i>
            <li>1.5 cups beef stock</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon ketchup</li>
            <li>2 drops sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced green onions, white and light green parts only</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups hot cooked white rice</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season patties with salt, pepper, and cayenne; set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk together beef stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, cornstarch, ketchup, sugar, and sesame oil in a bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 5 minutes. Flip patties; add green onions and cook until both beef and onions are browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove patties and most of green onions to a plate.</li>
            <li>Pour beef stock mixture into the skillet. Stir, scraping up browned bits from the bottom, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and reserve gravy until needed.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining butter in another skillet over medium heat. Add eggs to the skillet and fry side-by-side until whites are set and yolks are still runny.</li>
            <li>Divide rice between 2 serving bowls. Place patties over rice, spoon gravy on top, and add fried eggs.</li>
